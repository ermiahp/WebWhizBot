# Telegram Bot

This is a basic Telegram bot created using Node.js. The bot provides three options: `/option1`, `/option2`, and `/option3`, each executing a different function.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine.
- A Telegram Bot token.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install node-telegram-bot-api
   ```

3. Replace `'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'` in `bot.js` with your actual bot token.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, use the following command:

```bash
node bot.js
```

The bot is now running and listening for the commands `/option1`, `/option2`, and `/option3`.

## Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. Install the [Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html).

2. Initialize an Elastic Beanstalk application by running:
   ```bash
   eb init -p node.js my-telegram-bot
   ```

3. Create an environment and deploy your bot application with:
   ```bash
   eb create my-telegram-bot-env
   ```

4. To open your application in a web browser, use:
   ```bash
   eb open
   ```

## Usage

After starting the bot, use it by sending one of the commands (`/option1`, `/option2`, `/option3`) in the chat. The bot will respond confirming the selected option and execute the associated function.
